## Proxy Object Observe



This super simple library uses ES6 Proxies to provide an API similar to the now deprecated Object.observe spec.

If you want to read more about Proxies, you can read the accompanying blog post; [Metaprogramming in ES6: Part 3 - Proxies](https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/metaprogramming-in-es6-part-3-proxies/).

## Install:

```bash
npm i proxy-object-observe
```

## Usage:

Simply call the exported function with an object and a callback, and each time the object is modified the callback will be fired with some kind of change. The return value of the function is an object with the `object` key - which is the Proxied object, and the `unobserve` function, which - when called - will mean the callback is never fired again, making `object` behave like it was never proxied in the first place.

```js
const proxyMethodMissing = require('proxy-method-missing');
const changes = [];
const { object, unobserve } = observe({ id: 1 }, (change) => changes.push(change));
object.a = 'b';
object.id++;
Object.defineProperty(object, 'a', { enumerable: false });
delete object.a;
Object.preventExtensions(object);
assert.equal(changes.length, 5);
assert.equal(changes[0].object, object);
assert.equal(changes[0].type, 'add');
assert.equal(changes[0].name, 'a');
assert.equal(changes[1].object, object);
assert.equal(changes[1].type, 'update');
assert.equal(changes[1].name, 'id');
assert.equal(changes[1].oldValue, 1);
assert.equal(changes[2].object, object);
assert.equal(changes[2].type, 'reconfigure');
assert.equal(changes[2].oldValue.enumerable, true);
assert.equal(changes[3].object, object);
assert.equal(changes[3].type, 'delete');
assert.equal(changes[3].name, 'a');
assert.equal(changes[4].object, object);
assert.equal(changes[4].type, 'preventExtensions');
```
